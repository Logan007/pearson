# Pearson Hashing
This repository contains an implementation of a "Fast Hashing of Variable-Length Text Strings" as suggested by Peter K. Pearson in The Communications of the ACM  Vol.33, No.  6 (June 1990), pp. 677-680 – the so called **Pearson Hashing**.

The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_hashing) article contains a good description. Also, it links to a `.pdf` copy the original paper.

The underlying principle of this algorithm is easy to understand. Simplicity shines!

Note that this is not a cryptographicly secure hashing function, so it cannot be used to prove knowledge of a secret without showing that secret. But it is well suited for keying hash tables or to compress or expand given entropy of some byte-string to a different number of bytes or just as a checksum. Its design also allows to verify smaller parts of the hash value if required.
